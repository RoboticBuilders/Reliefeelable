3D models of paintings
Our approach to getting 3D models from paintings is straightforward and includes just 3 steps:
1. Get the depth map of the image,
2. Add images features like edges & contours into the depth map,
3. Convert the depth map into a 3D model by converting depth to 3D pixel height on the Z-axis.

# Depth maps from monocular images 
Depth maps provide depth info for each pixel in the image.
